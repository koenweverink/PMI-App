# PMI-App

This is a project made for the Police Academy of Apeldoorn. This app uses the Henssge method to calculate the Post Mortem Interval (PMI). 
This is the uncompiled code. If you want to build it into a working app, you will need a Linux machine with the buildozer library installed. 

The app can be found in the Google Play store as PMI Calculator (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.policeacademy.pmi.pmiapp&gl=NL).

## Guide

1. Enter the victim's measured body temperature in Celsius.
2. Enter the ambient temperature.
3. Enter the approximation of the victim's body weight.
4. Select, if any, the body covering of the victim.
5. Select the environmental factors.
6. Enter the date and time of the calculation. This is automatically set as today and right now. 
7. Press "Schat PMI" 

The resulting popup will tell you the estimated time of death.

You can now press "Back" to go back to the main screen, or "Save" to start the saving procedure. 
If you have pressed "Save", enter a case number and press "Save" again.
Now press "Back"

On the bottom of the screen there is a tab called "Saved PMI". Press here to see the saved PMIs. NOTE: if you have just entered a new PMI, you must refresh the page by pulling the page down. Click on a case number and here you will see all kinds of information regarding the calculation, such as:

* The entered data
* The calculated Correction Factor
* The estimated minimum PMI
* The estimated maximum PMI
* The used calculations

The calculations are explained at the "Info" tab in the top-right of the main screen.
